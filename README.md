# Linux-on-eMmc-for-S905
When you get stubborn about the Amlogic S905...
A few years ago, I purchased an MXQ Pro 4K (extended name: Amlogic S905 with DTB Meson GXBB p201), an Android TV box designed to upgrade an old television by introducing the capabilities of Google's operating system, allowing access to apps and more. Later on, I discovered communities that had made these devices highly efficient by installing minimal Linux distributions on them. My first thanks go to those communities: the people behind LibreELEC (especially kszaq), coreELEC, Kodi, and everyone developing and sharing solutions. Using Kodi directly, without going through Android, made everything smoother, and the countless plugins enabled virtually unlimited expansion of the TV box. For example, tvheadend, when combined with a USB stick (similar to those used for SKY), transformed it into a DVB-T decoder as well.

Over the years, the advent of Android TVs has made this small but great device somewhat obsolete. As I always do when a device no longer meets the minimum requirements for its original purpose, I start looking for an alternative useâ€¦
